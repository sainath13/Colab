need name
name logo
need catchy phrases

need to meet managers of phoenix mall etc event managers,
popular pubs, brewerys
popular shoe brands
or small burger place

the thing is 
brands are of two types
really successful brands
soon going to be successful brands

games as well


influencers have limit of having more than 10K followers
there should be limit on how many collaborations that you create.
each collaboration is a hit on db side
need to think this through

Need to include more data on profile like city etc

getting people to work as models to the app is kind of going to be hard or might be easy
if followers are in the middle range

create a dev profiles for you and brother as influencer
randomise on client side. appropriate message that suggests what exactly is happening
can answer any queries directly instead of send mails and reporting bugs

give public access to all the peopleto trello list so that they can see whats in the pipeline
write create terms and conditions properly
 
in the beginning there just going to be no community
1 weeks since app is launched
influencers joined
brands joined
on a single line.
with some welcome message

Pre-Launch App Marketing Plan:
create a landing page for your app.
#validate the idea
create your app store description and get started with App Store Optimization
. My personal favorite is SensorTower. 

ensure that the analytics tool which you are using to track your app is properly setup.
setup analytics properly

partner with influencers
